      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>This section contains information about yourself. Write a brief bio here describing who you are, what you do, and what you're passionate about.
        Hello! I‚Äôm Harshika, a dedicated and detail-oriented web development student with a strong passion for turning ideas into interactive, engaging, and accessible websites. I'm currently learning full-stack web development, with a focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and gradually diving into React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB.

I first got interested in web development because I‚Äôve always been fascinated by how websites work ‚Äî how something as simple as a button click can trigger a whole user experience. That curiosity led me to study the foundations of web development, and I‚Äôve been building my knowledge and skills ever since through tutorials, practice projects, and online courses.

üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Technologies I‚Äôm Learning:
Front-End: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React (basics), Responsive Design, Bootstrap

Back-End: Node.js, Express.js (beginner level), MongoDB

Tools: Git & GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Chrome DevTools, Figma (basic prototyping)

Soft Skills: Problem-solving, attention to detail, self-motivation, willingness to learn, collaboration

üíª Current Projects
Right now, I‚Äôm working on:

A personal portfolio website to showcase my projects and progress

A JavaScript-based to-do list app with localStorage integration

Exploring how to build a basic API with Node.js and Express

Each project is an opportunity for me to try new things, make mistakes, and learn by doing ‚Äî which I believe is the best way to grow as a developer.

üöÄ Goals
Build a strong foundation in full-stack development

Contribute to open-source or real-world projects

Land an internship or junior web developer role

Eventually specialize in either front-end development or UX-focused engineering

üå± Why I Love Web Development
Web development allows me to blend creativity and technology ‚Äî writing code that solves problems, improves lives, or just makes someone's day easier. I love the idea that a small piece of code I write could one day help someone shop, learn, or connect with others online.
